# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Using ride-sharing data to comparing Urban, Suburban and Rural city types.
The data is broken down into Amount of rides per city type, Amount of fares per city type, and amount of drivers per city type, and the averages of all of those breakdowns for comparison. 


## Results
This is an overall contextual bubble plot showing the data before being broken down into city type subsections.

As one can see, the individual ride fares for rides in rural city types are more than the majority of ride fares in urban city types. Almost as can be expected, amenities are much closer to people in urban settings, and further apart in rural settings. Also, it's noticable, but predictable, that there are more rides being taken in the urban settings than anywhere else.

Here, we compare the amount of rides, the amount of fares, and the amount of drivers per city setting.

These charts are fairly self-explanatory, and really only take a slightly deeper look at the relationships we could already see in the first chart: there are more rides in urban settings, the rides are longer in rural settings, and there are fewer drivers in suburban and rural settings.

This fare summary chart breaks down the the total amount in fares per week for each of the city settings.

This chart is the clearest showcase that the sheer amount of rides in the urban settings outweigh the the difference in average fare amounts where the rural setting held its only advantage.  The rural market just doesn't have enough riders to compete with either of the other markets. 

## Summary
Based on the charts we made from the data, there are a few recommendations that could be made to the PyBer company. There are three more charts that will help us make these recommendations.

- In an ideal situation, the "% of Total Rides pie chart" and the "% of Total Drivers" pie chart would be the same. That there are discrepancies, means that there are either too few or too many drivers for the city setting.
- The amount of money brought in from total fares and the strongly sugggests that it might not be worth existing in rural areas. Clearly the urban setting (and also suburban, though to a lesser extent) is where the money comes from, and should be the company's focus.
- If the company intends to continue trying to work in the smaller markets, they need to find a way to have more drivers. The discrepancies between the amount of rides, and the amount of drivers is too vast, especially when you consider the extended length of each trip. There should be some kind of extra incentive for rural and suburban drivers in order to increase their number.
